```


```{r}

# ibp4 is highly correlated with both lbp1 and lbp3, lbp4 is also the least correlated with our outcome variables so that is the feature we will delete to address the multicolinearity

for (col in names(x_variables)) {
  boxplot(x_variables[[col]], main = paste("Boxplot of", col), ylab = col)
}

# While the box plots do show that we have outliers we do not have any evidence that these outliers are an error, for now we will leave them in until we decide on the features that we are keeping and then we will revisit how to address them (possibly z-score 3 std's away)
```


```{r}
# Because the values are not normally distributed we decided to use normalization over standardization 

#normalizing x values to put them on a similar scale for analysis 
adpkd_x_vars_normalized <- as.data.frame(lapply(x_variables, function(x) {
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
}))

#normalized to a range between 0 and 1
```


Task 1: For part 2 and part 3 we should do a linear regression, a ridge regression and a lasso regression so that we can compare them and decide on which linear model works best, then we can choose the model that gives us the best AIC and lowest mse as our final model for that part 

```{r}
y_variables <- adpkd_no_multico[, c("Subject.ID", "tkvht_visit2","progression","tkvht_change")]

#randomly split data into 70/30 
sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(combined_normalized), replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.7,0.3))
